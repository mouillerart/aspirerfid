 * A NotificationChannel is used to report notifications to a single host. It
 * has a list of Sources associated with it. Only events coming from these
 * Sources shall be reported. It also has a DataSelector that determines what
 * data should be reported to the host. If no DataSelector is explicitly
 * associated, then the Readers current DataSelector shall be used.
 * Notification shall be sent whenever the associated Trigger fires.
 * Alternatively, a host can also query the NotificationChannel for its
 * contents, using the command NotificationChannel.readQueuedData().
 * <br /><br />
 * This is the local client stub which can be used to access the remote object on
 * the reader.
