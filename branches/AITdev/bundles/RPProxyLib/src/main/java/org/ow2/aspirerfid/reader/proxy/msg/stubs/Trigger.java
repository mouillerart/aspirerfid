/**
 * A Trigger is a non-mutable object that can exist as a composite member of
 * either a Source or a NotificationChannel object, i.e., Trigger objects are
 * added and removed from Source and NotificationChannel objects. There is one
 * pool of Trigger objects. Source and NotificationChannel objects can both
 * reference the same Trigger object. Source and NotificationChannel objects can
 * contain zero or up to a predefined maximum number of total Trigger member
 * objects. A Trigger shall be activated as soon as it is added to another
 * object. It shall be deactivated once it has been removed from all objects it
 * had been added to, i.e. when it is not associated with any other object.
 * <br /><br />
 * This is the local client stub which can be used to access the remote object on
 * the reader.
